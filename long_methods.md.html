<h1>Long method descriptions</h1>
<h2>Client -&gt; Server</h2>
<h3>Connect</h3>
<p>The connect (CONNECT) method signals the server whom is connecting and what extensions the client supports. A request with this method must be sent immediately after establishing a connection with the server.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p><code>CONNECT !name ![exts]</code></p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p><code>CONNECT stevejobs 01</code>: The client is called stevejobs and supports extensions 0 and 1.</p>
<p><code>CONNECT hans</code>: The client is called hans, and supports no extensions.</p>
<h4>Errors</h4>
<p>The server is allowed to send a timeout error if the server decides the CONNECT method is not called in time.</p>
<h3>Disconnect</h3>
<p>The disconnect (DISCONNECT) method signals the server that the client will close the current socket. This command is mandatory, however upon TCP timeout, the socket can be closed too.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p><code>DISCONNECT</code></p>
<h3>Game ready</h3>
<p>The game ready (GAME READY) method signals the server the client is ready to accept a random game to be assigned. The server is not required to respond immediately after this method.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p><code>GAME READY</code></p>
<h4>Errors</h4>
<p>Illegal method use: The server is allowed to send this command if the client is ready already.</p>
<h3>Game unready</h3>
<p>The game unready (GAME UNREADY) method signals the server that the client may not be assigned a random game anymore.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p><code>GAME UNREADY</code></p>
<h3>Game move</h3>
<p>The game move (GAME MOVE) method may only be called while the client is in a game and it is his turn. This command tells the server the X and Y coordinates he wishes a playpiece may be placed. These coordinates, in the minimum implementation of this protocol, range from 0-3. The Z-coordinate is derived automattically by the state of the board.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p><code>GAME MOVE !x !y</code></p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p><code>GAME MOVE 0 2</code>: Lets the server know it must attempt to place a piece at (0, 2)</p>
<p><code>GAME MOVE 2 1</code>: Lets the server know it must attempt to place a piece at (2, 1)</p>
<h4>Errors</h4>
<p>Illegal move: The player has made a move at a moment it is not allowed to or at a position it is not allowed to.</p>
<p>Illegal method syntax: Either one or both coordinates are missing.</p>
